Java Project

Client/Server program that allows client to upload a file to server or download a file from server. Instructions
on how to use are at the top of each program. I know there are libraries that can already accomplish this but I 
wanted to demonstrate a small client/server project. 

I plan to also do this project in C, C++ and python.
