Java Project

This is a simple Client/Server program written in Java using TCP Sockets. The Client connects to the Server and can either
upload a file to the Server or download a file from the Server. The purpose of this program was to demonstrate 
the usage of TCP Sockets in Java. The basics of programming a Client and Server program using TCP Sockets is covered. 
The usage of DataOutputStream/DataInputStream, chained to BufferedOutputStream/BufferedInputStream, are included as 
well to send/receive strings between the Client and Server and to send bytes for sending file content between the Client 
and Server. 

I am also starting another project in Java that will utilize OOP principles as well as TCP Sockets, multi-threading, etc. 
Stay tuned!
